# Process & Memory Analysis Toolkit
  ## Description

    ### This repository contains tools and libraries written in Assembly, Go (Golang), C++, and Python designed for process and memory analysis, vulnerability detection, and defense against various types of exploits. The project includes DLL files, DOS utilities, and other low-level tools for analyzing system internals, processes, and memory states.
# Features

    Process Monitoring: Tools for monitoring active processes and analyzing their behavior.
    Memory Analysis: Utilities for inspecting memory regions, heap, and stack allocations.
    Vulnerability Detection: Scripts and tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in running processes or memory states, such as:
        Unencrypted HTTP traffic
        Memory leaks
        Unauthorized memory access
    DOS Tools: Utilities for DOS-level interaction with system internals.
    Cross-Platform Support: The tools are designed for use on Windows systems, with some tools supporting Linux as well.

# Languages & Tools Used

    Assembly: Low-level memory manipulation and process interaction tools.
    Golang: High-performance utilities for real-time process and network analysis.
    C++: Libraries for detailed system-level interaction and vulnerability detection.
    Python: High-level scripting tools for integrating analysis and detection capabilities with other components.
