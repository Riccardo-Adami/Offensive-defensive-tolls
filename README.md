## Description

This repository contains tools and libraries written in Assembly, Go (Golang), C++, and Python designed for process and memory analysis, vulnerability detection, and defense against various types of exploits. The project includes DLL files, DOS utilities, and other low-level tools for analyzing system internals, processes, and memory states.

## Features

- **Process Monitoring**: Tools for monitoring active processes and analyzing their behavior.
- **Memory Analysis**: Utilities for inspecting memory regions, heap, and stack allocations.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Tools to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as:
  - Unencrypted HTTP traffic
  - Compressed data (potential malware)
  - Memory leaks
  - Unauthorized memory access
    and so on...
    
- **DOS Tools**: Utilities for interacting with DOS and DDOS attacks for bug bounty 
- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - **Windows**: Most of the tools are designed to work on Windows systems. (most golang scripts are designed for windows)
  - **Linux**: Some tools are specifically designed for Linux environments.(specifically some memory tools)

## Languages & Tools Used

- **Assembly**: Low-level memory manipulation and process interaction.
- **Golang**: High-performance utilities for process and network analysis.
- **C++**: System-level libraries for detailed interaction and vulnerability detection.
- **Python**: Scripting tools to integrate analysis and detection capabilities.
