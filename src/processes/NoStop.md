### How to Keep Your Process Alive on Windows

If you want to keep other processes from killing your app, here are a few tricks that can help. Remember: if someone’s got admin rights, there’s no foolproof way to stop them. But these steps will make it a lot harder for unwanted processes to mess with yours.

### 1. Run as a System Service

Make your app a Windows service, so only users with admin privileges can stop it. Set it up with "Automatic with restart" so if it ever goes down (or someone tries to kill it), Windows will just restart it automatically. This gives your app a lot more resilience than a typical process.

### 2. Lock Down Access with Permissions

Use Windows API functions like `SetSecurityInfo` to set up restricted permissions on your process. Lock it down so only specific users or processes can access it. This won’t stop someone with admin rights, but it’ll block out regular processes from messing with it.

### 3. Use a "Watchdog" Process

Create a second process that monitors your main process. If one goes down, the other can detect it and restart it. You can even set them up to monitor each other, so if one gets killed, the other brings it back up right away.

### 4. Mark as a "Critical Process" (Last Resort)

In extreme cases, you can set your process as a "critical process" using some undocumented API calls like `NtSetInformationProcess`. If a critical process is killed, Windows will blue screen (yes, the dreaded BSOD). Be careful with this one: it’s a nuclear option and can make the system super unstable.

### 5. Keep Tabs on "Suspicious" Processes

Use Windows APIs like `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` and `Process32First/Process32Next` to scan for specific processes by name that might try to mess with yours. You can monitor the system for them and take action if they show up. This won’t block them from doing anything, but it gives you a heads-up.

### 6. Auto-Restart Logic Inside the App

Add a self-check timer inside your app. If it notices the app is going down (or something’s trying to shut it down), it can trigger an auto-restart. This gives your process some self-healing if someone tries to kill it off.
